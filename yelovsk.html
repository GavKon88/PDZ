    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The shelling of the Yelovsk Power Plant marked one of the most controversial flashpoints in the early stages of the <a href="zegracrisis.html">Zegra Secession Crisis</a>. On the night of April 2, 1992, federal artillery units opened fire on the Yelovsk power facility, allegedly due to intelligence reports suggesting it was being used to shelter Zegra Directorate Party (ZDP) militants.</p>

    <h2>The Incident</h2>
    <p>The barrage lasted several hours and resulted in significant structural damage to the facility. Most critically, the turbine hall collapsed, killing three civilians — two plant workers and a local maintenance supervisor — and injuring eight others, several of whom suffered long-term disabilities. Power outages cascaded across the Yelovsk district for nearly 48 hours, deepening civilian resentment against the federal presence.</p>

    <h2>Reactions and Denial</h2>
    <p>Eyewitness reports and local radio intercepts attributed the shelling to a nearby federal artillery unit stationed outside Kovchag. The Russian government, however, denied responsibility, claiming instead that the incident was a "false flag" staged by regionalist forces to foment rebellion and attract foreign attention.</p>
    <p>Despite photographic and audio evidence gathered by Zegra sympathizers, Moscow refused to acknowledge the shelling, dismissing all materials as "fabricated provocations." This denial further eroded federal legitimacy and fueled the Directorate’s propaganda efforts.</p>

    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>The Yelovsk shelling became a rallying cry for pro-autonomy supporters. In the weeks that followed, recruitment to Directorate militias surged, and several municipal councils passed resolutions condemning federal military actions. International watchdogs, though limited in access, cited the Yelovsk attack in early reports documenting human rights abuses during the crisis.</p>

    <p>The incident is now memorialized in PDZ civic curricula and annual commemorations as a symbol of resistance and sacrifice.</p>
