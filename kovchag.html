    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Kovchag Labor Crackdown was one of the bloodiest labor suppression events during the <a href="zegracrisis.html">Zegra Secession Crisis</a>. It occurred amid rising unrest among industrial workers protesting economic instability, wage theft, and unsafe conditions at the Kovchag Metallurgy Plant, one of the region's largest employers.</p>

    <h2>The Strike and Response</h2>
    <p>On April 11, 1992, over 300 workers at the plant began a sit-in strike, blocking cargo deliveries and halting operations. The protest was peaceful, with organized demands for salary arrears, medical coverage, and regional autonomy guarantees. However, the federal authorities labeled the strike as “sedition” and dispatched interior riot units to disperse the workers.</p>

    <h2>The Crackdown</h2>
    <p>Eyewitnesses reported that without warning, federal riot police stormed the plant grounds using rubber bullets, tear gas, and live rounds. In the ensuing chaos, at least seven workers were confirmed killed, including two union organizers. Dozens more were injured or arrested. Among the wounded were bystanders and clerical staff uninvolved in the protest.</p>

    <h2>Reactions</h2>
    <p>Local authorities decried the use of force, but federal media downplayed the event, referring to it as a “necessary restoration of order.” No official inquiry was launched, and no federal personnel were held accountable. The crackdown galvanized sympathy for the Directorate cause among industrial workers and unions throughout the Zegra region.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>The Kovchag Labor Crackdown is regarded in the PDZ today as a martyrdom event in the narrative of resistance against central exploitation. A memorial plaque stands at the plant gates, and April 11 is commemorated annually as Workers' Justice Day in Zegra. Survivors and families continue to seek recognition and compensation, though the Russian Federation maintains silence on the event.</p>
