        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The <em>Druzhna Blackout Arrests</em> occurred amid growing unrest in the Zegra region. As the <a href="zegracrisis.html">PDZ</a> pushed back against Russian occupation, a citywide blackout —widely believed to be engineered by Russian intelligence— plunged neighborhoods into darkness. Under this cover, Russian federal troops executed a planned crackdown, targeting civilians suspected of sympathizing with the PDZ. With 7 deaths and 18 injuries among the 63 arrests, 22 remain missing to date. The missing are presumed to have been imprisoned within Russian-controlled territories.</p>

        <h2>Details of the Arrests</h2>
        <p>63 individuals were arrested in the night by Russian forces— many of whom never reappeared. The operation specifically targeted community organizers, academics, journalists, and former officers known for resisting Russian control. These arrests were not sanctioned by any civilian authority in Zegra and were most likely carried out with the intent of decapitating the resistance movement.</p>
        
        <h2>Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Eyewitnesses at the time reported brutal beatings and forced removals, and human rights monitors believe many of the missing were transferred to undisclosed detention facilities within Russian-controlled territory. Families were left without answers, and Russian authorities issued no records or formal charges. The brutality of the raid intensified anti-Russian sentiment of the PDZ and its supporters.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>The <em>Druzhna Blackout Arrests</em> are remembered as a turning point in Zegra’s struggle for self-determination. The event symbolized the lengths to which the Russian Federation would go to maintain control, and further solidified support for Zegra’s eventual secession. The memory of those disappeared during the blackout continues to inspire activism and political discourse throughout the region.</p>
