    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <a href="zegracrisis.html">People's Directorate of Zegra</a> (PDZ) operates under an authoritarian system characterized by centralized power, suppression of dissent, and ideological conformity. The state’s political apparatus is built around the Directorate Party of Zegra, which maintains a monopoly on political expression and governance.</p>

    <h2>Core Tenets</h2>
    <p>The PDZ blends elements of Soviet-era socialism with modern nationalist and statist rhetoric. It emphasizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>State control</strong> over key industries and infrastructure.</li>
      <li><strong>National unity</strong> and collective purpose under the Directorate.</li>
      <li><strong>Political loyalty</strong> enforced through mass surveillance and internal security services.</li>
      <li><strong>Isolationism</strong> and suspicion of foreign influence, especially from Western powers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Shift After Vezhar's Death</h2>
    <p>Under the early rule of <a href="konstantin.html">Premier Konstantin Vezhar</a>, the PDZ maintained tight control but still sought to preserve a degree of institutional legitimacy. While repressive, his government projected an image of ideological order and national restoration following Zegra’s break from the Russian Federation.</p>
    <p>This changed sharply after Vezhar's unexpected death in 2020, resulting in the rise of <a href="morozov.html">Antonovich Morozov</a>. Morozov’s leadership marked a significant hardening of the regime. What had been a controlled authoritarian state transformed into a deeply paranoid and brutal dictatorship. Political purges accelerated, secret police expanded their reach, and dissidents vanished in sweeping “cleansing operations.”</p>
    <p>Morozov also reversed limited cultural liberalizations introduced under Vezhar. Independent unions, NGOs, and academic institutions were shuttered or absorbed into the state apparatus. The ideological line shifted from a focus on social stability to one of permanent revolutionary vigilance against “enemies within.” The result was a climate of fear that pervaded everyday life.</p>

    <h2>Governance and Repression</h2>
    <p>Premier Morozov rules with near-total authority. The regime routinely uses mass arrests, media censorship, and disappearances to maintain power. Political opposition is virtually nonexistent, and civil liberties are heavily curtailed under the pretext of national security.</p>

    <h2>Public Messaging</h2>
    <p>State propaganda emphasizes Zegra’s independence, its historical victimization by foreign powers (particularly Russia and NATO), and the righteousness of its ideological mission. Education and media are tightly controlled to reinforce the Directorate's narrative.</p>

    <h2>International Standing</h2>
    <p>The PDZ is diplomatically isolated, recognized by few nations. It is frequently criticized by international human rights organizations for its authoritarian practices, yet the regime remains defiant, portraying itself as a bulwark against external subversion and globalism.</p>
