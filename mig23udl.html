    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>The Mikoyan MiG-23UDL (Russian: Микоян МиГ-23УДЛ) is a modernized multirole fighter aircraft, developed as a late-life extension of the original MiG-23 “Flogger” platform. Requirements were issued by the <a href="ZTI.html">ZTI</a>, and development was undertaken in cooperation with several national defense-industrial contractors. The UDL (short for “Универсальный Дальний Легкий”, or Universal Long-Range Lightened) was designed to refurbish and reintroduce stored Soviet-era MiG-23 airframes with 21st-century avionics, sensors, and weapons systems. Initiated in the early 2020s, the program offered a cost-effective path toward modern multirole capability without the expense of acquiring entirely new aircraft.</p>
    <p>Though based structurally on late-model MiG-23ML and MLD airframes, the UDL incorporates composite control surfaces, an upgraded cockpit with multifunction digital displays, a lightweight active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and a modular fire-control system. As part of its survivability upgrades, the UDL also incorporates a radar-absorbent paint finish designed to marginally reduce frontal radar cross-section. While not a stealth platform, this treatment—paired with selective airframe sealing and panel smoothing—contributes to reduced detectability during head-on or low-altitude approaches. The platform is capable of deploying modern precision-guided munitions alongside legacy Soviet-era ordnance, and supports a full range of air-to-air weapons including the domestically-produced <a href="zk11.html">ZK-11</a> high-agility IR missile, as well as inherited R-27 variants. Modular datalink architecture, missile approach warning systems (MAWS), and integrated electronic countermeasures allow for scalable configuration across different operational roles. Select airframes retain the ability to carry tactical nuclear munitions.</p>
    <p>The program resulted in three primary variants: the initial MiG-23UDL prototype and pre-production batch, followed by the refined MiG-23UDL-E1, and culminating in the more capable and widely fielded MiG-23UDL-E2. Although production numbers remain small compared to the original MiG-23 family, the UDL has demonstrated impressive results in national trials and is actively employed in multirole duties including interception, close air support, and advanced pilot training.</p>
    <p>No dedicated strike variant of the UDL was produced, though the MiG-27’s reinforced fuselage and undercarriage were used as references during the configuration of the E2 standard for extended ground-attack operations. While lacking the MiG-27’s armored tub and fixed optical targeting suite, later UDLs were evaluated with externally mounted designator pods to enable delivery of laser- and satellite-guided munitions.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <h3>Armament</h3>
    <p>The MiG-23UDL’s armament reflects the modernization goals behind its upgrade program, balancing legacy hardpoint compatibility with updated fire control and targeting systems. The baseline UDL retained the GSh-23L 23 mm twin-barrel autocannon and introduced the SUV-23UDL fire control suite, integrating a lightweight AESA radar and multifunction digital displays. Air-to-air loadouts typically consist of two domestically-produced ZK-11 high-agility infrared-guided missiles, supported by either R-27R (semi-active radar) or R-27T (infrared) medium-range missiles. The fire control system allows for simultaneous tracking and cueing of multiple targets and is fully integrated with helmet-mounted sighting systems, offering a marked improvement over legacy variants.</p>
    <p>For strike missions, the UDL is cleared to employ Kh-25ML and Kh-29L laser-guided missiles with support from a centerline-mounted targeting pod. Standard loadouts include up to four S-13 rocket pods, various general-purpose FAB and OFAB bombs, or two RBK-500 cluster munitions, with a total payload capacity of up to 3,500 kg (7,700 lb). Compatibility with precision-guided munitions such as the KAB-500L and satellite-guided KAB-500S-E has been implemented on later production airframes, supported by improved avionics and reinforced pylons. Limited integration testing has also been carried out with the Grom-E1 air-to-surface missile, though it remains reserved for specific platforms.</p>
    <p>The UDL’s electronic warfare capability includes the optional carriage of ECM pods in place of outer air-to-air missiles, as well as a standard countermeasure suite featuring UV-based missile approach warning sensors, flare dispensers, and active chaff ejectors. Later-production models incorporate wingroot modifications for dual-rail short-range missile launchers, improving readiness and missile count. As with late-generation MiG-23MLD variants, the UDL retains the ability to carry a single tactical nuclear munition—either the RN-24 or RN-40—via a specialized fuselage adapter, though this remains limited to selected airframes under national strategic protocols.</p>
    <h3>Cockpit</h3>
    <p>The MiG-23UDL features a substantially reworked cockpit, replacing the analog instrumentation of the original “Flogger” with a fully digital glass cockpit layout. Central to the upgrade is a multifunction display (MFD) suite providing customizable radar, navigation, and targeting information, supported by a digital moving map and integrated datalink interface. The cockpit is fully night-vision compatible and fitted with a modern wide-angle HUD, allowing seamless transition between air-to-air and air-to-ground modes.</p>
    <p>A helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system is standard on the UDL-E2 variant and available as a retrofit on earlier models, providing target cueing and seeker slaving for the ZK-11 and other compatible weapons. Hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls are implemented to support improved pilot workload management during high-speed engagements. Environmental upgrades include a redesigned pressurization system and improved canopy seals for enhanced pilot comfort and high-altitude performance.</p>
    <h3>Control Surfaces</h3>
    <p>To improve responsiveness and reduce maintenance burden, the UDL incorporates new composite-material control surfaces on the elevators, rudder, and leading-edge slats. These provide modest reductions in weight while improving corrosion resistance and structural longevity. The aircraft retains its variable-geometry wing design, with a strengthened wing-sweep mechanism and digital control logic tied into the flight computer for smoother transitions at different airspeeds and mission profiles.</p>
    <p>Upgraded actuators and control surface hinges have extended service life and improved agility, particularly in the dogfight regime where rapid roll and pitch response is critical. Additionally, aerodynamic refinements were made to the wingroot fairings and vertical stabilizer fillet to reduce drag and buffet during high-alpha flight.</p>
    <h3>Engine</h3>
    <p>Power is provided by a refurbished Tumansky R-35-300 turbojet engine, extensively overhauled with modern digital engine control modules (DECM) and reinforced turbine components. While the UDL does not use a new-generation engine, reliability and thrust consistency have been improved through digital monitoring and fault prediction algorithms.</p>
    <p>Thrust output remains comparable to late-model MiG-23MLD figures, with up to 12,500 kgf (27,600 lbf) in afterburner. Select UDL-E2 units are reportedly equipped with an upgraded R-35-300P variant featuring an improved afterburner section and better cold-weather starting reliability. Engine life extension kits were included as part of the modernization package, increasing mean time between overhauls (MTBO) by approximately 20%.</p>
    <h3>Fuel</h3>
    <p>Internal fuel capacity is unchanged from the MiG-23ML baseline, totaling approximately 4,900 liters (1,300 US gal). However, modifications to fuel pumps and transfer sequencing have improved delivery efficiency during aggressive maneuvers and high-altitude operations.</p>
    <p>The UDL retains compatibility with the standard PTB-800 and PTB-1150 external fuel tanks, allowing extended-range missions. In certain UDL-E2 configurations, a modified ventral pylon supports a single centerline PTB-1500 drop tank. No in-flight refueling capability was integrated due to cost constraints, though the topic was studied during early development.</p>
    <h3>Performance Tests</h3>
    <p>Comprehensive flight testing of the MiG-23UDL series was conducted between 2022 and 2024 at the Kalensk Air Range and the Zoryan Aerospace Flight Center. Initial UDL prototypes demonstrated stable flight characteristics and significant improvements in radar performance, target acquisition time, and missile cueing compared to legacy MiG-23MLD aircraft. A reported increase in kill probability was observed in simulated engagements using ZK-11 missiles and R-27R pairs.</p>
    <p>During ground-attack trials, the UDL-E2 achieved consistent hits with laser-guided ordnance when paired with the Solara-2 external targeting pod. Cluster munitions and unguided bombs were also tested, with results comparable to MiG-27 baselines under similar loadouts.</p>
    <p>Electronic warfare trials validated the function of integrated MAWS and flare/chaff systems, with the MAWS system reportedly detecting inbound infrared missiles at up to 5 km with sufficient warning time for countermeasures. Operational reliability across temperature extremes was rated as high, and engine performance degradation was minimal at altitudes exceeding 14,000 m.</p>

    <h2>Variants</h2> 
    <h3>MiG-23UDL (2020–2021)</h3>
    <p>The original prototype and low-rate production batch served primarily as a test platform for avionics integration, systems modernization, and radar compatibility validation. These airframes featured early versions of the AESA radar and digital cockpit systems, but lacked full support for modern weapons and datalink functions. Limited off-boresight cueing, partial targeting pod integration, and basic fire control software characterized the UDL’s initial configuration. Despite these limitations, the UDL proved the viability of upgrading stored MiG-23 airframes and formed the basis for follow-on improvements. Most were later reassigned to secondary duties or retrofitted to E1 standards.</p>
    <h3>MiG-23UDL-E1</h3>
    <p>The E1 represented the first formal production variant, refining and stabilizing the avionics suite introduced on the prototype models. It introduced full compatibility with the ZK-11 missile, improved datalink reliability, and better integration with modern helmet-mounted sights and targeting pods. Structural reinforcements were made to the wing pylons and main gear to better handle modern ordnance loads. The E1 also benefited from incremental software updates to the radar and fire-control systems, resolving many of the early UDL’s integration gaps. While produced in limited quantities, the E1 served as a valuable operational baseline and informed the development of the more versatile E2.</p>
    <h3>MiG-23UDL-E2</h3>
    <p>The E2 is the most capable and widely produced variant of the UDL family. It features an improved cockpit layout with updated HOTAS ergonomics, extended missile compatibility—including the R-27T/R and KAB-series PGMs—and support for dual-rail launchers on short-range missile pylons. Additional refinements include expanded MAWS coverage, upgraded software for faster radar cueing, and improved reliability of onboard electronics across a wider range of environmental conditions. The E2 forms the core of the current UDL-equipped fleet and continues to receive incremental software and systems updates as of mid-2025.</p>
